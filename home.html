    <h1>LAMIA</h1>
    <p>Lamia was a queen of Libya who was loved by Zeus. Out of jealousy, Hera killed her children and cursed her with eternal torment. Transformed into a monster, Lamia became a devourer of children and a wandering spirit. Her pain and vengeance lived on, whispered through centuries as a symbol of loss, rage, and darkness.</p>

    <h2>Music as a Medium</h2>
    <p>“Each track is a data packet, a shot fired into the system. Each sound, a breach.”</p>
    <p>[Lamia's sonic weapon is still under development. Audio payloads will be deployed soon]</p>
